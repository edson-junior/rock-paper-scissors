# Rock, Paper, Scissors (lizard, spock!!!)

It's been built with: ES6, Webpack, Gulp, Chai/Mocha

## The rules:

- Scissors beats Paper
- Rock beat Scissors
- Paper beats Rock
- If both players choose the same, the round is counted as a tie.
- Player A always chooses Paper
- Player B chooses randomly
- Player A wins 310 of 1000 games, Player B wins 370 of 1000 games, Tie: 320 of 1000 games

## Usage:

```javascript
npm i && gulp
```
## Run test:

```javascript
npm run test
```

## Advantages:

- es6! :);
- Code is readable, sweet and to the point;
- It uses Webpack. A more robust, easy-to-use build tool instead of RequireJS;
- Very easy to run localy.

## Disadvantages:

"Player A wins 310 of 1000 games", "Player B wins 370 of 1000 games", "Tie: 320 of 1000 games" didn't make a whole lot of sense to me, so I didn't implement it. Maybe we should do a pair-programming out of this, if possible.
