# Rock, Paper, Scissors

** refactoring in progress **

## The rules:

- Scissors beats Paper
- Rock beat Scissors
- Paper beats Rock
- If both players choose the same, the round is counted as a tie.
- ~~Player A (Computer) always chooses Paper~~
- Player A (Computer) chooses randomly
- Player B (Human) chooses normally
